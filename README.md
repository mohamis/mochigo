## üìç Getting Started

This project was created on Flutter (Channel stable, 3.3.6, on macOS 13.0 22A380 darwin-arm, locale en-FR).

The Mochigo project is a project that aims to create an app for selling and buying Mochi.
Mochi (È§Ö, „ÇÇ„Å°) is a Japanese rice cake made of mochigome, a short-grain japonica glutinous rice, and sometimes other ingredients such as water, sugar, and cornstarch. The rice is pounded into paste and molded into the desired shape.

We will build an application that will have two users:

- Buyers (clients): They can create an account, buy Mochi and put it in the cart, they will have also the option to see their buying history.
- Sellers (stores): They can put new articles, see the sells and future click and collect orders.

samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

# üõ£ Project

A project created in flutter using GetX and Provider. We supports both web and mobile, follow the respective instructions here:

- For Mobile: https://github.com/
- For Web: https://github.com/

**Subject**
Name: MOCHI&GO

Description: Our application allows us to order mochi and collect them in store in click and collect. There will be the merchant part with a user (store) and customer part (with the basic user), he can connect, fill in his personal information, put a profile picture.

The user can drop a photo taken with his phone in the application to review the mochi and leave comments. We will use a minimalist approach in the design of the application with animations to bring the application to life. At first we will have one store but if we do well we will have several stores.

As a customer, he will be able to choose his mochi or a pack, add it to the card, and a dummy payment system allowing him to buy a product (choice of payment). Summary of the order in his customer area (purchase history).

As a manager, he can receive the order, say when it's ready for the collect click, sales stats (sale of mochi, users etc).

Login via email / password.

### üìÇ Folder Structure

Here is the core folder structure which flutter provides.

```
flutter-app/
|- android
|- build
|- ios
|- lib/
|-- controller/ (for cotrollers)
|-- core/
|----models/
|----theme/
|-- presentation/ (screens are there)
|----widgets/
|-- providers/ (providers)
|-- services/ (for services)
|-- services/ (for storage services mainly)
|-- utils/ (used for colors)
|- test
```

### üë©üèª‚Äçüé® UI

This directory contains all the ui of your application.

We use ![Figma](https://img.shields.io/badge/figma-%23F24E1E.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=figma&logoColor=white) and Photoshop to mockup our application and you can find results in the `ui` directory as shown in the example below:

```
ui/
|- login
   |- login_screen.png
|- register
    |- register_screen.png
```

### üèö Main

This is the starting point of the application. All the application level configurations are defined in this file i.e, theme, routes, title, orientation etc.

        // is sufficient.
        Provider(create: (BuildContext context) => CatalogModel()),
        // CartModel is implemented as a ChangeNotifier, which calls for the use
        // of ChangeNotifierProvider. Moreover, CartModel depends
        // on CatalogModel, so a ProxyProvider is needed.
        ChangeNotifierProxyProvider<CatalogModel, CartModel>(
          create: (BuildContext context) => CartModel(),
          update:
              (BuildContext context, CatalogModel catalog, CartModel? cart) {
            if (cart == null) throw ArgumentError.notNull('cart');
            cart.catalog = catalog;
            return cart;
          },
        ),
        ChangeNotifierProvider(
          create: (_) => CartProvider(),
        ),
      ],
      child: GestureDetector(
        onTap: () {
          final FocusScopeNode currentFocus = FocusScope.of(context);
          if (!currentFocus.hasPrimaryFocus &&
              currentFocus.focusedChild != null) {
            currentFocus.focusedChild!.unfocus();
          }
        },
        child: GetMaterialApp(
          theme: MochigoTheme.mytheme,
          title: 'Mochigo: All taste good',
          home: const MyExplicitAnimation(),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
